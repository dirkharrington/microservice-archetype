# Nanite
A bare bones, unopinionated, archetype for microservices based on [rapidoid](http://www.rapidoid.org/http-fast.html).

# Why?
Rapidoid provides a clean, new, api using modern Java idioms for the web that help you write code w/o being hindered by large frameworks.
While not included by default most of the rapidoid frameworks are expected to solve the majority of needs for a microservice. I can usually get everything I want/need w/o leaving the rapidoid stack.

I found myself using rapidoid frequently, but got tired of all the boilerplate stuff, so I injected nanite into my workflow!

# Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. mvn install
3. mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local
4. Choose this archetype
5. Profit
